# ✨ All-You-Need: Your AI Specialist Toolkit ✨

Hey there! I've put together this collection of code snippets and examples – stuff I've been working on, things I think are super useful for anyone diving deep into applied AI. I wanted to share it with you, hoping it'll help you become the best AI specialist you can be.

**(Insert a cool, minimalist GIF here, perhaps showing abstract AI concepts or code flowing. Example: a looping animation of neural network nodes lighting up or a simple terminal animation with commands scrolling.)**

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This isn't just a random pile of code. It's got some of the key things I've been focusing on:

* **🧠 LLM Workflows:** Think of these as blueprints for making large language models actually do cool stuff. We're talking about chaining prompts, routing, doing things in parallel, automating code reviews, and figuring out how to make everything work better.
  
* **🔍 RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** This is where we teach LLMs to use external info, making them way more powerful. I've got a couple of different ways to do this in here.
  
* **🤖 Agentic Patterns:** You know, making AI agents that can actually *do* things. I've got some patterns and examples of getting them to work together.
    
* **💬 Chat Completions:** Connecting to different LLMs, like OpenAI and Groq, and getting them to chat.
   
* **🛠️ Function Calling:** Making LLMs use tools and functions – it's a game-changer.
    
* **🤗 Hugging Face Integration:** Using models and APIs from Hugging Face.
   
* **Plus:** Agents, presentation generators, Notion API stuff, FastAPI endpoints, authentication, and LangChain examples.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Here's how you can get this running on your machine:

1.  **Grab the files:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Set up a safe space:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ```
3.  **Get the tools:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **🔑 Add your keys:**
    * Make a copy of `.env_example` and name it `.env`.
    * Put your API keys (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.) in there.

## 🗺️ Where to Look

* **📝 Prompts:** Check out the `prompts/` folder for some cool prompt tricks.
* **🔄 Workflows:** `llm_workflows/README.md` has the lowdown on those workflows.
* **📂 Details:** And each folder has its own README with the details.

## ⚠️ Important Stuff

You'll need to add your API keys to the `.env` file.

## 🤝 Let's Work Together

If you find anything cool or have ideas, feel free to jump in:

1.  Make a copy of this.
2.  Add your own stuff.
3.  Send it back!

I really hope this helps you out. Let me know what you think!
